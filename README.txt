This is a simple program consisting of a server and a client. 
Before running the code, make sure the python files, and 
the "hi.txt" files are in the same folder. The code does run
on my machine without any errors but that's with me babying
the program (not providing awkward inputs).

Steps for using the program:

1) Run "server Project" file
2) Run "client Project" file
3) In the client console, type a name for the incoming file from the server.
    This file is a copy from the server so you need to give the incoming file
    a new name.
4) After naming the incoming file, you should see the new file in the folder
    with the other project files.

NOTE: To test the try catch, try changing the "fileName" variable in the 
server file, and run the program as normal after. The program should 
throw a "file not found" error.
